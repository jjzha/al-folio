  abstract={Recent technological advances underscore the dynamic nature of the labor market. These transformative shifts yield significant consequences for employment prospects, resulting in the increase of job vacancy data across platforms and languages. The aggregation of such data holds the potential to gain valuable insights into labor market demands, the emergence of new skills, and the overall facilitation of job matching. These benefits extend to various parties, including job platforms, recruitment agencies, applicants, and other stakeholders within the ecosystem. However, despite the prevalence of such insights in the private sector, we lack transparent language technology systems and data for this domain.
  The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology for the extraction of relevant information from job descriptions. We identify several general challenges within this domain. These encompass a scarcity of available training and evaluation data, a lack of standardized guidelines to annotate data, and a shortage of effective methods for extracting information from job ads.
  Therefore, we embark on a comprehensive study of the entire process: First, framing the problem and getting annotated data for training NLP models. Here, our contributions encompass job description datasets, including a de-identification dataset, and a novel active learning algorithm designed for efficient model training. Second, we introduce several extraction methodologies to tackle the task of information extraction from job advertisement data: A skill extraction approach using weak supervision, a taxonomy-aware pre-training methodology adapting a multilingual language model to the job market domain, and a retrieval-augmented model leveraging multiple skill extraction datasets to enhance overall extraction performance. Lastly, given the extracted information, we delve into the grounding of this data within a designated taxonomy.},
