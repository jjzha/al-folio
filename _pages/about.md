Hello there! My name is Mike Zhang. I'm a third-year PhD Student at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU)
under supervision of Prof. <a href="http://bplank.github.io"><u>Barbara Plank</u></a> and dr. <a href="http://robvanderg.github.io"><u>Rob van der Goot</u></a>. I am part of the
<a href="http://nlpnorth.github.io"><u>NLPnorth</u></a> research unit at the IT University of Copenhagen and also affiliated with
the <a href="https://mainlp.github.io"><u>MaiNLP Lab</u></a> at
<a href="https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/ueber_uns/index.html"><u>CIS</u></a> (Center for Information
and Language Processing) at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU).

In Spring 2023, I will be visiting <a href="https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg"><u>WING</u></a> (Web Information
Retrieval & Natural Language Processing Group) at the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof.
<a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/"><u>Min-Yen Kan</u></a>. I will work on NLP and IR related to job descriptions and related text sources.

My main focus is working on automated high-quality Information Extraction from unstructured text with real-life use cases that have societal impact.
In my case, I am working on Skill Extraction for Job Market Analysis.
My other interests include tricks and approaches to get more labeled training data and/or exploit models for tasks with limited data â€”
this includes Active Learning, Weak Supervision, and Transfer Learning.
