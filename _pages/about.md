Hello there! My name is Mike Zhang. I'm a Postdoc in NLP at Aalborg University (AAU, Copenhagen campus) advised by Prof. <a href="https://bjerva.github.io/"><u>Johannes Bjerva</u></a>. My research is currently focused on NLP for Education.

Previously, I was a PhD Student in NLP at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU)
advised by Prof. <a href="http://bplank.github.io"><u>Barbara Plank</u></a> and Prof. <a href="http://robvanderg.github.io"><u>Rob van der Goot</u></a>. I was part of
<a href="http://nlpnorth.github.io"><u>NLPnorth</u></a> at ITU and <a href="https://mainlp.github.io"><u>MaiNLP</u></a> at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). I worked on Computational Job Market Analysis (or NLP for HR), where we investigated how to extract information from job advertisement data and match these to existing resources (e.g., taxonomies).

I am interested in:
  - **NLP for Education**: Can we improve students' learning by giving them automatic feedback from NLP tools (e.g., language models)? How can we do this over time?
  - **NLP for HR**: How can we extract relevant skills from job ads and in what way can we match them with existing taxonomies to assist job centers matching candidates to jobs better?
  - **Expertise**: My knowledge is mostly on resource creation, developing annotation guidelines for data annotation, (multilingual) datasets creation in general and specific domains, and language model training on small and large scale.
